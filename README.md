# unjs-inspect.barbapapazes.dev

A simple script to inspect the UnJS website using [unlighthouse](https://unlighthouse.dev/). It's pretty important to easily see how the website is doing in terms of performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO and to have an overview of the changes over time.

This will run automatically every Monday and Thursday at 07:00 UTC using GitHub Actions.
